# Plot & Pacing

## Prologue:
Your prologue spent a lot of wasted space talking about various races and nations of Whinhlem. This kind of lore dumping is counter-productive to pulling readers in. As a general rule, readers don't care about lore until you've made them care about the characters. The thing that's working for you here is the spatial magic, followed by Eydis getting yeeted into our world. (I thought your bait & switch into our world's technology was well done, btw).

## First act:
In my head, I've separated your book into 2 acts. The first constitutes everything leading up to Justin's migraine. The second is where the bulk of the Lurr-Eydis storyline takes over. 

### Highlights:
* I was positively surprised when the fire mage minum got run over when he came through the portal.
	* You used Jethro's relevance to get me invested in this character that I hated, and then he ruthlessly and unexpectedly died. It was fantastic.
	* Note: The POV hop into his perspective felt kinda bad.
		* I try to balance the following with POV hops:
			* Unless it's the beginning chapters of the book, the new POV needs to be connected to things I already know. (People, places, events)
			* The lengthier the scene, the more immediate the above context needs to be.
			* If it's a really lengthy scene, I need to want to know more about this new POV character BEFORE you put me in their head.
		* Looking at the above 3 notes, I think my biggest issue with this scene was that it felt too long. Part of why his death felt so good was because I literally spent most of the chapter thinking "I really don't want to read more POV's from this character."
			* IMPORTANT: That thought isn't always a bad thing for a shorter scene. This was a good bait and switch. I think you should keep it and tighten it.
* The migraine.
	* I loved everything about this scene. Granted, I'm super biased because it resonated with my personal experience.
	* Personal note: 
		* For me, when I wake from migraines, I have a particularly weird notion where it feels like my brain was creating dreams specifically using the migraine pain as the building blocks. It's weird, but it's almost like my brain is saying "wtf is this? It shouldn't be here," and it tries to dispose of it using dreams as a tool of memory-deletion.
		* These dreams, in particular, feel different from any other dream. Like I can't remember what the dream was about, and I get the impression it wasn't _about_ anything. I feel like I definitely had a dream, and it was just an amalgam of pain.
		* This, in particular, felt like it fit well with your concept of poison ven expulsion. The body has no clue what it's supposed to do with all the junk energy.
	* As much as I loved this, I also don't think it belongs in book one. :sad-face: 
		* I will note more on this thought after I recap each of the 2 acts.
		
### General Strengths:
* The way Eydis learns of things in our world is well done.
	* I enjoyed the "modern amenities are fascinating/magical" observations. You did well bringing them in organically throughout the novel.
		* **Concern:**
			* I think these concepts are more of a staple in YA fiction?
			* As someone who rarely reads YA fiction (aside from a few authors who are guests to the genre), I'm not sure if I'm the right audience to trust on this particular topic.
			* Will average readers be as interested as I was?
* Justin/Sammy/Eydis friendship.
	* Everything about this friendship felt incredibly organic.
	* In the last chapters, when Eydis reflects on the slice of life she's carved out for herself in our world, it felt real. Most of that was a result of how organically this friendship developed.
	* **Caveat:** I have some concerns about how it serves the greater narrative.

### Worst moment:
* The introduction of Lurr-Eydis.
	* Everything about this scene confused me. I will die on the hill that Lurr-Eydis needs to be given a different name, purely for the reader's convenience.
	* Even with a name distinction, I think this scene would have issues. The first several chapters with Lurr-Eydis, you hadn't gotten me invested in learning about her. I think it was three chapters into her perspective when I finally realized why she was going to be important, when the reveal of her being a Lurr finally occurred.
		* I'll talk more about that scene in part 2 feedback.

### General Weaknesses:
* None of the relationships built in part 1 played a role in the climax/resolution/ending.
	* For this single reason, I feel like almost all of part 1 has to be completely rewritten or punted to book 2. The narrative is too disjointed.
* Eydis

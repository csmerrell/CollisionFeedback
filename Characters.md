# Characters

## Core strengths & weakness
You do a great job of organically building relations between all of your characters. I know I'm making lots of criticisms of your novel, but character relationships is by far your biggest strength. I pretty much felt like every conversation in the entire novel felt organic.

Maybe the best way to highlight this is to focus on the most problematic bond in your whole novel: Eydis & Justin.

Their relationship felt so organic to me that it took me a long time before I came to the conclusion that I want you to scrap what you have and fundamentally change it. Eydis feels weak in a way that isn't healthy for an MC--she makes almost every single one of her decisions in the entire novel based on being useful to Justin, who honestly isn't amazing enough to earn the level of devotion she gives him. 

## Elf Eydis
Right now, Eydis's entire character arc is derived from only two motivations: 
1. "I need to hide from Jethro."
2. "I don't want to be a burden."

Both of these are real, valid motivations, and you justify them so well that I never really questioned them. She felt organic and real.

But she also felt incredibly weak as a main character. Considering her backstory, that _can't_ be her core motivation. She was royalty. She was trained by the best spatial mage in Whinhlem. And she was good at it. So good that she held off a Lurr-giant AND two professional soldier-mages in your climactic battle.

With the death of her family, she is the only person with any claim to the throne. Her mentor gave his life to save her. The people she was raised to care about are bound in slavery back home. Many of them are suffering.

But her arc trades "last hope of my people" vibes for "conspicuously misplaced mage yeeted into a YA slice of life in our strange world of modern amenities."

I think you have two options with Eydis:

### Make her weakness and abandonment of her people deliberate by contrasting it against her Lurr counterpart.
In this option, you take the two Eydis's and basically set it up so Lurr Eydis eventually "wins" because she's the better, more honorable princess. While the original was off hiding and carving out a happy, comfortable life in our world, the fake was actually trying to save the people of a kingdom that only created her as a decoy.

When you started ramping up Lurr-Eydis' story in the second half of the novel, I honestly started to suspect this was your intent. As it stands, this option would feel super bad, though.

You spend the first act of your novel getting me invested in Eydis and Justin and her life in our world. Meanwhile, Lurr-Eydis doesn't really get developed until the second half of the book. And her introduction has issues that really turned me off to her (more details in her subsection).

# Characters

## Core strengths & weakness
You do a great job of organically building relations between all of your characters. I know I'm making lots of criticisms of your novel, but character relationships is by far your biggest strength. I pretty much felt like every conversation in the entire novel felt organic.

Maybe the best way to highlight this is to focus on the most problematic bond in your whole novel: Eydis & Justin.

Their relationship felt so organic to me that it took me a long time before I came to the conclusion that I want you to scrap what you have and fundamentally change it. Eydis feels weak in a way that isn't healthy for an MC--she makes almost every single one of her decisions in the entire novel based on being useful to Justin, who honestly isn't amazing enough to earn the level of devotion she gives him. 

## Elf Eydis
Right now, Eydis's entire character arc is derived from only two motivations: 
1. "I need to hide from Jethro."
2. "I don't want to be a burden."

Both of these are real, valid motivations, and you justify them so well that I never really questioned them. She felt organic and real.

But she also felt incredibly weak as a main character. Considering her backstory, that _can't_ be her core motivation. She was royalty. She was trained by the best spatial mage in Whinhlem. And she was good at it. So good that she held off a Lurr-giant AND two professional soldier-mages in your climactic battle.

With the death of her family, she is the only person with any claim to the throne. Her mentor gave his life to save her. The people she was raised to care about are bound in slavery back home. Many of them are suffering.

But her arc trades "last hope of my people" vibes for "conspicuously misplaced mage yeeted into a YA slice of life in our strange world of modern amenities."

I think you have two options with Eydis:

### Make her weakness and abandonment of her people more deliberate by contrasting it more carefully and consistently against her Lurr counterpart.
In this option, you take the two Eydis's and basically set it up so Lurr Eydis eventually wins the right to the title of princess, because she's the more honorable princess. While the original was off hiding and carving out a happy, comfortable life in our world, the fake was actually trying to save the people of her kingdom, even though they only created her as a decoy.

When you started ramping up Lurr-Eydis' story in the second half of the novel, I honestly started to suspect this was your intent. As it stands, this option would feel super bad, though.

You spend the first act of your current draft getting me invested in Eydis and Justin and her life in our world. Meanwhile, Lurr-Eydis doesn't really get developed until the second half of the book. And her introduction has issues that really turned me off to her (more details in [her subsection](#lurr-eydis)).

Strategy:
* Give Lurr-Eydis a more clear role as _co-protagonist_ by giving her chapter 1.
    * Details in [her subsection](#lurr-eydis)
* Strip a lot of Elf-eydis' early chapters and get to the Justin/Sammy/Austin scenes asap.
* Spend a bit more time on her grief.
    * Give her a more officially recognized reason that she isn't sure she wants to try to go home.
* Do a bit more work after Lurr-eydis kidnaps her at the end to wrap this arc up and tie some sort of bow on it.

### Rewrite Elf-Eydis' to be more decisive and proactive
In this option, you spend more time on a few of the motivators that can make Eydis more decisive:
* Grief/memories of her family.
* Plans to try and understand Jethro's more advanced spatial magic (Now that she's seen it, she can dissect the things she nows and practice with it).
* Plans to more deliberately train mages in our world.
    * This motivator is easy to establish quickly if she just thinks: "If Jethro is so proficient, then humans really can be powerful mages. And I can use the shelter of this world to build up a strike team."

Some key differences in the way she would approach relationships:
* Less emphasis on being indebted.
    * She can still be honorable and want to repay kindness, but she should be less focused on "all I do is receive" and more focused on "I need to earn trust and build allies."
* More emphasis on attempted self-confidence and conflicted self-worth.
    * "Do I even matter enough to ask that these new friends risk their lives for me?"
* More emphasis on the idea that she can create better, more synergistic relations with the humans in her own world (based on her work with humans in our world).


### Things to get rid of (or reduce), regardless
* The language barrier chapters at the beginning. 
    * These really didn't do much for you. The professor is kind of a useless character in this book, and I was a good 40 pages in just with Justin and Eydis trying to cross the language divide. 
    * Either leverage Beowulf and internet resources right out of the gate, or find a way to hand-wave the language divide all together. 
* The fear of cell phones.
    * This is a valid concept, but I think you spent too much energy on it. It sets the stage for Eydis feeling super weak, when you really need more reasons for her to have strength (even conflicted strength) in your early chapters.
    * You don't need to completely excise it. Just have her get past it somehow.
* The scene where she's offered her own apartment.
    * This one was the peak of her feeling too irrationally attached to Justin. She can be fond of him, and she can want to stay close to him, but I think it's wrong (and you'll be skewered by critics of weak women) for your MC to be completely emotionally dependent on living with Justin.
    * NOTE: The way you currently handle this scene actually does work with your "refugee from abuse" narrative parallels. My main critique is just that it's problematic for a **main character** narrative.

### Things to try and keep
* Using life magic to pick out foods
* Ven mastery in the new world.
    * Maybe the ven training, if it fits the direction you choose.
* Learning biology/anatomy to augment her life magic.
* Maybe some physics/astronomy study to augment her spatial magic.

## Lurr Eydis
I had a weird kind of whiplash with Lurr Eydis.

The way you introduce her, I coded her as an antagonist in a way that made me reluctant to invest myself in her when you finally started developing her.
She goes from being:
- An intensely confusing body-double who is introduced a bit later than is healthy.
- A helpless captive trapped in a roomw with a gross monster that eats rotten blood and is covered in its own shit.
- A determined underdog, willing to do hard things to save even a few slaves.

Pretty much everything after she learns she is a Lurr is solid, and she is honestly your strongest, most unique character. I just had trouble rooting for her.

My recommendations for revisions with her are more straight-forward:
* Give her chapter 1.
    * Have Jethro go into her room and tell her she's a fake, but don't explain the Lurr side, yet. All he needs to do is show up and say "Kings keep bastards and body-doubles of princes and princesses all the time for succession-insurance."
        * Seal this pretty easily with some witnesses who can tell the difference.
    * **IMPORTANT** She needs her own, distinct name. You made a valiant effort of balancing it by using the people around them for context, but it was still deeply confusing for me at times.
        * Have Jethro decide on calling her something different to drive it home: "You're not really Eydis. You're a fake."
        * Options:
            * Jethro fabricates a birth document or testimony from someone who delivered the baby for her "real mother." She chooses to use her "real" name.
            * Jethro calls her Fake'amel (or something insulting). She decides on her own name based on something she cherishes.
    * In chapter 1, Jethro explains a bit of the princess's escape: "Once we're ready, I'm sending you to find the real princess. Kill her, and you can have her name and title. I'll install you as regent when you officially declare your people's surrender."
* Chapter 2: Jump to Elf-Eydis.
* Chapter 3: The fire mage minum and his unexpected death. (Shorten this chapter as tight as you can. Your current draft spent too long on this character's POV)
* Chapter 4: More Elf-Eydis.
* Chapter 5: Come back to Lurr-Eydis.
    * Jethro explains the lack of check in from his first scout through the portal---> "I assume he's dead."
        * Teaches Lurr-Eydis instant transmission (so she's less likely to die.)
            * Lurr-Eydis being a spatial mage also gives credibility for why Jethro would specifically decide to send _her_ next.
        * Promises her resources in exchange for information about the new world.
        * Establishes a hostage situation.
            * If you don't return through the portal at appointed times, I will execute these hostages.
        * Teacher her how to open the portal to our world, and how to craft a return portal herself.

From here, the rest can proceed pretty organically, but I'd note a few of my thoughts:
* If you can find a way to make it organic, have Lurr-Eydis deliberately _not_ teach Jethro that his portal exits into a street.
    * Have it be a small rebellion that she revels in knowing his scouts are likely to get run over.
* Keep the lurr-feeding subplot, but space it out more over multiple chapters.
    * Keep the reveal that this Eydis is a Lurr for a mid-novel plot twist, but now we have better investment in her when her self-image is shattered.
    * This also gives you more opportunity to foreshadow it, with her wondering why she can sense the other Eydis so well.
        * Set up some mystery for it with her thoughts: "Did they weave some sort of enchantment over me when they decided I would be her body double?"
* Give Lurr-eydis an early scene somewhere where she deliberately chooses _not_ to kill Eydis (despite having the opportunity).
    * "Do I want to be the princess? Do I want to be her?"
    * Heighten the stakes of this dilemma by having her worry about the hostages back in Whinhlem.
* Use the abduction of Austin as a more pivotal wrench in Lurr-Eydis' plans.
    * She knows who Austin is, and she knows he's a scumbag, but she's been hiding details of her observations from Jethro.
    * When Austin is brought into the palace, she has an "Oh shit" moment where she tries to figure out "does Jethro know exactly how useful this man is?"

## Justin
I don't have a lot of feedback or recommendations with Justin. I liked him. I liked what you were doing with his poison ven accumulation. I liked his friends. I liked his roommate. I liked pretty much everything you were doing with him. I loved the eventual relationship that built up between him and Eydis.

But NONE of it factored into the direction your primary tension curve took once you started developing Lurr-Eydis. Justin was useful as a refuge for Eydis, but once that was established, he really didn't do anything useful for the novel's plot curve.

Your core tension curve lies in the dual-princess story. Justin's role in book 1 needs to be rethought to serve and augment that curve.

# General Feedback

## Bottom Line Up Front:
I think this book needs a lot of work, but it's definitely got promise. I enjoyed certain parts of it a lot, but a fair number of your arcs didn't feel like they were taking me anywhere important. In its current state, I wouldn't yet recommend it to friends.

## Core summary of my feedback:
At its core, book 1 is really "A tale of two Eydises" (awkward plural lol). You should strip and/or retune nearly everything that doesn't serve this core plot and punt it to book 2 by any means possible.

### **CORE ISSUE:** Two separate stories that don't synergize.
1. The story of Eydis finding her place in our world and building a ragtag band of YA mages.
2. The story of Lurr-Eydis, conflicted about balancing (a) hunting Elf-Eydis, and (b) salvaging something good beneath Jethro's thumb.

In your climax, you fail to pull these two narratives together in any satisfying way.
* Lurr-Eydis has the strongest presence in the entire last half of the book, especially the climactic scenes. I got the impression you were building toward a bait & switch where she becomes the main character, and I legitimately dreaded this possibility because the way you introduced her arc coded her as an antagonist to Elf-Eydis, who had been coded as the protagonist.
	* You can still tell a fantastic story of these two princesses being antagonistic, but the way you've done it in this draft, you spend too much time on Elf-Eydis before Lurr-Eydis really gains any depth.
* Justin is completely absent from the final confrontation, so all that time we spent with him and his friends learning magic is completely wasted space as far as a "book one" goes. In this current draft, he's one of the MCs. You can't sideline him in the final act.

### Granular critique of your plot curve
I wrote a separate document critiquing the plot curve as it is (It's just a critique. No suggestions). It's mostly just my personal justification for the conclusions I've drawn.

## My suggested strategy for revisions

### Retune the plot to make the dual-Eydis arc the core story
Lurr Eydis arguably has your strongest character arc, but it's hampered way too much by the way you introduced her.
1. Make Lurr-Eydis a dual-MC right out of the gate. I'd actually give chapter 1 to her.
	* More details in the character document: [Lurr Eydis](https://github.com/csmerrell/CollisionFeedback/blob/main/Characters.md#lurr-eydis).
2. Rethink Elf-Eydis' arc to make her more proactive, rather than reactive.
	* More details in the character document: [Elf Eydis](https://github.com/csmerrell/CollisionFeedback/blob/main/Characters.md#elf-eydis).
3. Make Justin a side character ---> Introduce him later. Reduce Eydis' immediate, almost irrational attachment to him, and convert it to a slow-burn development of trust.
	* More details in the character document: [Justin](https://github.com/csmerrell/CollisionFeedback/blob/main/Characters.md#justin)

### Scenes that you should definitely keep:
* (Prologue) Jethro kills Eydis' family
* Lurr-Eydis feeds the Lurr and discovers what she is.
	* I would space this out more. Details in her character subsection.
* Jethro's Fire mage interrogator minum ----> And then he gets run over by the car.
	* The Jethro-Emer stuff needs some work to set this up better, tho.
* The entire climax with the Dwarf and his crew.
* The entire subplot with Lurr-Eydis and Rynn.
	* I'd adjust the Austin portion of this, though. Details in [Lurr Eydis](https://github.com/csmerrell/CollisionFeedback/blob/main/Characters.md#lurr-eydis) character subsection.
* Lots of Elf-eydis' scenes are still very useful, but I think you'd have to integrate them into different scenes with the way I'd recommend retuning her side of the story.
	* Details in [Elf Eydis](https://github.com/csmerrell/CollisionFeedback/blob/main/Characters.md#elf-eydis) character subsection.

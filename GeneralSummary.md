# General Feedback

## Bottom Line Up Front:
I think this book needs a lot of work, but it's definitely got promise. In its current state, I wouldn't yet recommend it to friends.

## Core summary of my feedback:
At its core, book 1 is really "A tale of two Eydises" (awkward plural lol). You should strip and/or retune nearly everything that doesn't serve this core plot and punt it to book 2 by any means possible.

### **CORE ISSUE:** Two separate stories that don't synergize.
1. The story of Eydis finding her place in our world and building a ragtag band of YA mages.
2. The story of Lurr-Eydis, conflicted about balancing (a) hunting Elf-Eydis, and (b) salvaging something good beneath Jethro's thumb.

In your climax, you fail to pull these two narratives together in any satisfying way.
* Lurr-Eydis has the strongest presence in the climax. I got the impression you were building toward a bait & switch where she becomes the main character, and I legitimately dreaded this possibility because the way you introduced her arc coded her as an antagonist to Elf-Eydis, who had been coded as the protagonist.
	* You can still tell a fantastic story of these two princesses being antagonistic, but the way you've done it in this draft, you spend too much time on Elf-Eydis before Lurr-Eydis really gains any depth.
* Justin is completely absent from the final confrontation, so all that time we spent with him and his friends learning magic is completely wasted space if you look at book one in a silo.
